# 825-c-ipcam
Recently I baught an ipcamera and it turns out to be completely online only usbale.  My internet speed being < 80k upload made this device completley useless. To boot no matter the configuration it is always sending information directly to ipaddresses that made block with an easy config in my Pi Hole.
